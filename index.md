### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

Lab 3 part 1 was one of my favorite labs because we had to implement a function using variables and formulas relating to math logic. I was able to determine the unit price of the pizza, which was in dollars per square inch. This ends up helping the customer determine which pizza has the overall best value for your buck.
