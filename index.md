### CPSC 120

* [Lab 3](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-03-adam-and-rajat)

Lab 3 part 1 was one of my favorite labs because we had to implement a function using variables and formulas relating to math logic. I was able to determine the unit price of the pizza, which was in dollars per square inch. This ends up helping the customer determine which pizza has the overall best value for your buck.  

* [Lab 4](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-04-adam-rajat)

Lab 4 part 2 is also one of my favorite labs because it's about building a number guessing game that involves 2 players, and you also have to have good coding logic in order to make it work. I was successful in building and coding a simple, but very effective, number guessing game using my coding skills.

* [Lab 9](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-09-rajat-and-quentin)

Lab 9 part 1 was one of my favorite labs because we had to implement an averaging algorithm that eliminates the minimum/maximum scores using for loops and solid coding logic. Me and my partner were very successful in building a program that implemented the averaging algorithm that met all the requirements, and met the code requirements.
